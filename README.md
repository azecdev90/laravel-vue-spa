# Laravel Vue SPA
This is single page application made with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework. Frontend is strapped with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility-first framework. This project simulates company app, so we have basic CRUD functionality here. In project, I implemented some of the best practices like *lazy loading components* in VueJS or using *Resources* for Laravel response. You can use this project as a starter template project for building your single page application, and modify according your requirements.
